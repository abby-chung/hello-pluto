# Hello Pluto

> A website project for a web developer beginner.

As a filmmaker, I have been struggling to put together all my works together. This website is dedicated to be a place for the photos I have taken, videos I have made, and stories I have written.

## Installing / Getting started

I am still not sure with the minimal setup you need to get a hello pluto up & running.

```shell
packagemanager install hello-pluto
hello-pluto start
hello-pluto "Do something!"  # prints "Not sure"
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above. (But I haven't figured out yet)

Give me some time, I will update this part.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.
(For now, I don't think I have.)

## Developing

Here is how you can start adding changes to the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abby-chung/hello-pluto.git
cd hello-pluto/
packagemanager install
```

After cloning hello-pluto, you can create a new branch and start making changes.
