# Hello Pluto
> A website project for a web developer beginner.

As a filmmaker, I have been struggling to put together all my works together. This website is dedicated to be a place for the photos I have taken, videos I have made, and stories I have written.

## Installing / Getting started

I am still not sure with the minimal setup you need to get a hello pluto up & running.

```shell
packagemanager install hello-pluto
hello-pluto start
hello=pluto "Do something!"  # prints "Not sure"
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above. (But I haven't figured out yet)

Give me some time, I will update this part.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.
(For now, I don't think I have.)


## Developing

Here is how you can start adding changes to the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abby-chung/hello-pluto.git
cd hello-pluto/
packagemanager install
```

After cloning hello-pluto, you can create a new branch and start making changes.

### Building
(TBD)
<!-- If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
``` -->

<!-- Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets executed. -->

### Deploying / Publishing
(TBD)
<!-- In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. -->

## Features

<!-- What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform? -->
* The main function is to showcase my works
* Visitors can discuss and reach out to me directly
* A platform for like-minded people sharing their works

## Configuration
(TBD)
<!-- Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project. -->

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute or share your thoughts. Please fork the repository and use a new branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

<!-- "If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome." -->

<!-- If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here. -->

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://github.com/abby-chung/hello-pluto
- Repository: https://github.com/abby-chung/hello-pluto.git
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/abby-chung/hello-pluto/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact chungchiachen06@gmail.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort to improve the security and privacy of this project!
<!-- - Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https ://github.com/someones/awesome-project/ -->


## Licensing
(TBD)
<!-- One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license." -->
